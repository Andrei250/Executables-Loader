Implementation:

- Firstly I initialise a new sigaction with flags, handler and mask.
- In so_execute, I opened the file with open() and then I will use 
  the data void* to store an array on integer. For each page of that
  segment, I have  avalue to check if that page is already mapped or not.
- In the handler, the steps are exactly as mentioned in the homework statement
  Firstly, I go through each segment and check if the address of the
  information is between the start of the virtual address of one seg
  and the end of it.

- If the address is not for the segments, then we will do the default action.
  Also, if the page is already mapped the default action will be used.

- Now I am in the situation when the page is not mapped. There are 2 cases:
  - case 1: the page is into the file range of addresses.
  - case 2: the page is between the end of file addresses and mem_size

- In each case I map the addres or the virtual address + addres of the page
  and I use mprotect to give permission depending on the segment.

- If the page is the last one, there is the situation when we should put 0s
  at the end of file_size.

- In the first case, I use mmap with the filePointer to laod the information
  from file.

- In the second case, I used 0, 0, because that page should contain only 0s.
